Welcome to the National Tracker, this web site allow you to view all of the National Parks around America. You can view the Parks as a guest user and simply click on one of the park links to get information on that park (name, location, entrance fees and a brief description). 

Create an account to allow you to start your own National Park tracker where you can add in the new parks that you have been to, or if you are already a user with us login back in to edit the Parks you have been to in the past and add new parks that you have visited for the fist time. 

When in your own Parks Tracker you will be able to add/edit information such as activities you did, the weather during your stay, did you camp or not, the dates you were there, and a comments section to record details about your stay.
